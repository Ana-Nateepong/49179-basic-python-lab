This work is used to teach us way to use if-else in python
1. determine the score if over or equal to 50 the outpust is pass if not the output is fall
2. similar to the first one but for odd and even number dn the % is to find the remainder if there is a remainder it odd if not it even
3. similar to the first two where the inout is the temperature and if it less than to equal to zero is freeze and it goes the same for Cold, Warm and Hot but in different range
4. The input is the score and those are added together to find the total then it determine the grade using if else
